# Global Sanctuary Fund Challenge

## Context
As a Frontend Developer at Global Sanctuary Fund, a non profit organization which has the mission to conserve nature and preserve the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on earth. 

The Organization yet don't have a Web Presence because of which they are not able to reach a wider audience and accomplish the mission. **Having a Web Presence, would increase the monetary contribution towards the Global Sanctuary Fund and would encourage voluntary participation from individuals**. Also, the millennials are most active in providing support to the organization. Hence, the organization is very keen on reaching the millennials with the information in the best possible way such that the information is ***well presented and organized***.

As a Frontend Developer, I would have to create a Web Page to showcase all the WildLife Conservation services by laying out information in a way that is quickly usable and readable to help GSF reach a wider audience.

### Facts
